Digital Signal Processing with a STM32 Nucleo Board, Stereo Audio Input and Output and a color display

Main Components:
- STM32 NUCLEO-L432KC: https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l432kc.html
- Digilent Pmod I2S2: https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-i2s2-stereo-audio-input-and-output/
- 2.8" TouchScreen ILI9314: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003840430655.html

Use the information in the folder "Hardware" to connect the three boards.

The folder "VUmeter_FFT_Demo" contains source files for software that demonstrates some of the hardware's capabilities. STM32 CubeIDE was used as the development platform

The driver for controlling the display was developed by Mauro De Vecchi (https://github.com/maudeve-it/ILI9XXX-XPT2046-STM32)
